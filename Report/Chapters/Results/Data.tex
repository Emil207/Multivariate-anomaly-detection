%\section{Simulation of data}
%Several instances were generated using the statsmodel package in Python. Supposed to look like real data. If I have time, try block bootstrapping for making data that resembles the specific use case.

%Possible building blocks:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Vibration sensors (involving frequencies)
%\item Temperature sensors 
%\item Proximity sensors
%\item Flow sensors
%\item Pressure sensors
%\item Level sensors
%\item Collective anomalies (appearing with specified frequency)
%\item Contextual anomalies (appearing with specified frequency)
%\end{itemize}

%All sensors should be possible to add as clustered sensors. Lag between specific sensors should be possible to add. To begin with no frequency variations will be applied.
