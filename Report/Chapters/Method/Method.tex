In [image] the model architecture is shown. A GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator. The generator is generating fake data to fool the discriminator and the discriminator is trying to detect if the generated data is fake. In [source] a framework for anomaly detection of multivariate time series is proposed. In the framework the generator takes its inputs from a random latent space. The entire variable set is treated concurrently to capture the interactions between the variables. Before discrimination the time series is divided into subsets with a sliding window. Based on the outputs of the discriminator, both the parameters of the discriminator and the generator are updated. The generator is exploited by reconstruction, the residuals between the reconstructed data and real-time testing samples. The discriminator is exploited by classifying the time series. A DR-score which is combining the two losses is used to detect potential anomalies.
