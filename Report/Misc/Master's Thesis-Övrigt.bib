abstract = {{\textcopyright} EURASIP 2017. In this paper we argue that the Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), instead of the spectrogram, should be used as basic input into convolutional neural network (CNN) based classification schemes. The WVD has superior resolution and localization as compared to other time-frequency representations. We present a method where a large-size kernel may be learned from the data, to enhance features important for classification. We back up our claims with theory, as well as application on simulated examples and show superior performance as compared to the commonly used spectrogram.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection in many applications is becoming more and more important, especially for security and privacy in mobile service computing domains with the development of mobile internet and mobile cloud computing, in which data are typical multidimensional time series data. However, the collective anomaly detection for multidimensional streams exists lots of problems, owing to the differences between the anomaly detection in multidimensional time series and univariate time series data. For example, the temporal continuity of multidimensional time series is much weaker than univariate time series and it is unreasonable to judge the entire multidimensional data as an anomaly if a certain dimension is abnormal. In this paper, we consider the statistical features of the subsequence of streams, proposing a novel collective anomaly detection algorithm for multidimensional streams based on iForest in cloud environment, namely iForestFS. When using different features about mobile cloud services' metrics suggested by domain knowledge, iForestFS could detect different kinds of anomalies for mobile service security. Furthermore, we implement distributed iForestFS using spark framework in order to improve time performance and scalability. The experimental results performed on three datasets(mainly about network security) derived from UCI repository demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect collective anomaly of multidimensional streams in security domain.},

@article{Liu2008,
abstract = {Most existing model-based approaches to anomaly detection construct a profile of normal instances, then identify instances that do not conform to the normal profile as anomalies. This paper proposes a fundamentally different model-based method that explicitly isolates anomalies instead of profiles normal points. To our best knowledge, the concept of isolation has not been explored in current literature. The use of isolation enables the proposed method, iForest, to exploit sub-sampling to an extent that is not feasible in existing methods, creating an algorithm which has a linear time complexity with a low constant and a low memory requirement. Our empirical evaluation shows that iForest performs favourably to ORCA, a near-linear time complexity distance-based method, LOF and Random Forests in terms of AUC and processing time, and especially in large data sets. iForest also works well in high dimensional problems which have a large number of irrelevant attributes, and in situations where training set does not contain any anomalies. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {Large companies need to monitor various metrics (for example, Page Views and Revenue) of their applications and services in real time. At Microsoft, we develop a time-series anomaly detection service which helps customers to monitor the time-series continuously and alert for potential incidents on time. In this paper, we introduce the pipeline and algorithm of our anomaly detection service, which is designed to be accurate, efficient and general. The pipeline consists of three major modules, including data ingestion, experimentation platform and online compute. To tackle the problem of time-series anomaly detection, we propose a novel algorithm based on Spectral Residual (SR) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our work is the first attempt to borrow the SR model from visual saliency detection domain to time-series anomaly detection. Moreover, we innovatively combine SR and CNN together to improve the performance of SR model. Our approach achieves superior experimental results compared with state-of-the-art baselines on both public datasets and Microsoft production data.},
