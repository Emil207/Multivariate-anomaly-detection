abstract = {Most existing model-based approaches to anomaly detection construct a profile of normal instances, then identify instances that do not conform to the normal profile as anomalies. This paper proposes a fundamentally different model-based method that explicitly isolates anomalies instead of profiles normal points. To our best knowledge, the concept of isolation has not been explored in current literature. The use of isolation enables the proposed method, iForest, to exploit sub-sampling to an extent that is not feasible in existing methods, creating an algorithm which has a linear time complexity with a low constant and a low memory requirement. Our empirical evaluation shows that iForest performs favourably to ORCA, a near-linear time complexity distance-based method, LOF and Random Forests in terms of AUC and processing time, and especially in large data sets. iForest also works well in high dimensional problems which have a large number of irrelevant attributes, and in situations where training set does not contain any anomalies. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {Time series (particularly multivariate) classification has drawn a lot of attention in the literature because of its broad applications for different domains, such as health informatics and bioinformatics. Thus, many algorithms have been developed for this task. Among them, nearest neighbor classification (particularly 1-NN) combined with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) achieves the state of the art performance. However, when data set grows larger, the time consumption of 1-NN with DTW grows linearly. Compared to 1-NN with DTW, the traditional feature-based classification methods are usually more efficient but less effective since their performance is usually dependent on the quality of hand-crafted features. To that end, in this paper, we explore the feature learning techniques to improve the performance of traditional feature-based approaches. Specifically, we propose a novel deep learning framework for multivariate time series classification. We conduct two groups of experiments on real-world data sets from different application domains. The final results show that our model is not only more efficient than the state of the art but also competitive in accuracy. It also demonstrates that feature learning is worth to investigate for time series classification.},

Given n numerical data streams, all of whose values we observe at each time tick t, SPIRIT can incrementally find correlations and hidden variables, which summarise the key trends in the entire stream collection. It can do this quickly, with no buffering of stream values and without comparing pairs of streams. Moreover, it is any-time, single pass, and it dynamically detects changes. The dis- covered trends can also be used to immedi- ately spot potential anomalies, to do efficient forecasting and, more generally, to dramati- cally simplify further data processing.

@article{Malhotra2015,
abstract = {—Anomaly detection plays an important role in pro-tecting computer systems from unforeseen attack by automati-cally recognizing and filter atypical inputs. However, it can be difficult to balance the sensitivity of a detector – an aggressive system can filter too many benign inputs while a conservative system can fail to catch anomalies. Accordingly, it is important to rigorously test anomaly detectors to evaluate potential error rates before deployment. However, principled systems for doing so have not been studied – testing is typically ad hoc, making it difficult to reproduce results or formally compare detectors. To address this issue we present a technique and implemented system, Fortuna, for obtaining probabilistic bounds on false positive rates for anomaly detectors that process Internet data. Using a probability distribution based on PageRank and an efficient algorithm to draw samples from the distribution, Fortuna computes an estimated false positive rate and a probabilistic bound on the estimate's accuracy. By drawing test samples from a well defined distribution that correlates well with data seen in practice, Fortuna improves on ad hoc methods for estimating false positive rate, giving bounds that are reproducible, comparable across different anomaly detectors, and theoretically sound. Experimental evaluations of three anomaly detectors (SIFT, SOAP, and JSAND) show that Fortuna is efficient enough to use in practice — it can sample enough inputs to obtain tight false positive rate bounds in less than 10 hours for all three detectors. These results indicate that Fortuna can, in practice, help place anomaly detection on a stronger theoretical foundation and help practitioners better understand the behavior and consequences of the anomaly detectors that they deploy. As part of our work, we obtain a theoretical result that may be of independent interest: We give a simple analysis of the convergence rate of the random surfer process defining PageRank that guarantees the same rate as the standard, second-eigenvalue analysis, but does not rely on any assumptions about the link structure of the web.},

@article{Munir2019,
abstract = {Traditional distance and density-based anomaly detection techniques are unable to detect periodic and seasonality related point anomalies which occur commonly in streaming data, leaving a big gap in time series anomaly detection in the current era of the IoT. To address this problem, we present a novel deep learning-based anomaly detection approach (DeepAnT) for time series data, which is equally applicable to the non-streaming cases. DeepAnT is capable of detecting a wide range of anomalies, i.e., point anomalies, contextual anomalies, and discords in time series data. In contrast to the anomaly detection methods where anomalies are learned, DeepAnT uses unlabeled data to capture and learn the data distribution that is used to forecast the normal behavior of a time series. DeepAnT consists of two modules: time series predictor and anomaly detector. The time series predictor module uses deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the next time stamp on the defined horizon. This module takes a window of time series (used as a context) and attempts to predict the next time stamp. The predicted value is then passed to the anomaly detector module, which is responsible for tagging the corresponding time stamp as normal or abnormal. DeepAnT can be trained even without removing the anomalies from the given data set. Generally, in deep learning-based approaches, a lot of data are required to train a model. Whereas in DeepAnT, a model can be trained on relatively small data set while achieving good generalization capabilities due to the effective parameter sharing of the CNN. As the anomaly detection in DeepAnT is unsupervised, it does not rely on anomaly labels at the time of model generation. Therefore, this approach can be directly applied to real-life scenarios where it is practically impossible to label a big stream of data coming from heterogeneous sensors comprising of both normal as well as anomalous points. We have performed a detailed evaluation of 15 algorithms on 10 anomaly detection benchmarks, which contain a total of 433 real and synthetic time series. Experiments show that DeepAnT outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods in most of the cases, while performing on par with others. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

This paper presents a robust algorithm for detecting anomalies in noisy multivariate time series data by employing a kernel matrix alignment method to capture the dependence relationships among variables in the time series. Anomalies are found by performing a random walk traversal on the graph induced by the aligned kernel matrix. We show that the algorithm is flexible enough to handle different types of time series anomalies including subsequence-based and local anomalies. Our framework can also be used to characterize the anomalies found in a target time series in terms of the anomalies present in other time series. We have performed extensive experiments to empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. A case study is also presented to illustrate the ability of the algorithm to detect ecosystem disturbances in Earth science data.},

@article{Baragona2007a,
abstract = {In multivariate time series, outlying data may be often observed that do not fit the common pattern. Occurrences of outliers are unpredictable events that may severely distort the analysis of the multivariate time series. For instance, model building, seasonality assessment, and forecasting may be seriously affected by undetected outliers. The structure dependence of the multivariate time series gives rise to the well-known smearing and masking phenomena that prevent using most outliers' identification techniques. It may be noticed, however, that a convenient way for representing multiple outliers consists of superimposing a deterministic disturbance to a gaussian multivariate time series. Then outliers may be modeled as nongaussian time series components. Independent component analysis is a recently developed tool that is likely to be able to extract possible outlier patterns. In practice, independent component analysis may be used to analyze multivariate observable time series and separate regular and outlying unobservable components. In the factor models framework too, it is shown that independent component analysis is a useful tool for detection of outliers in multivariate time series. Some algorithms that perform independent component analysis are compared. It has been found that all algorithms are effective in detecting various types of outliers, such as patches, level shifts, and isolated outliers, even at the beginning or the end of the stretch of observations. Also, there is no appreciable difference in the ability of different algorithms to display the outlying observations pattern.},

abstract = {Multivariate time series (MTS) datasets broadly exist in numerous fields, including health care, multimedia, finance, and biometrics. How to classify MTS accurately has become a hot research topic since it is an important element in many computer vision and pattern recognition applications. In this paper, we propose a Mahalanobis distance-based dynamic time warping (DTW) measure for MTS classification. The Mahalanobis distance builds an accurate relationship between each variable and its corresponding category. It is utilized to calculate the local distance between vectors in MTS. Then we use DTW to align those MTS which are out of synchronization or with different lengths. After that, how to learn an accurate Mahalanobis distance function becomes another key problem. This paper establishes a LogDet divergence-based metric learning with triplet constraint model which can learn Mahalanobis matrix with high precision and robustness. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied on nine MTS datasets selected from the University of California, Irvine machine learning repository and Robert T. Olszewski's homepage, and the results demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Mechanical devices such as engines, vehicles, aircrafts, etc., are typically instrumented with numerous sensors to capture the behavior and health of the machine. However, there are often external factors or variables which are not captured by sensors leading to time-series which are inherently unpredictable. For instance, manual controls and/or unmonitored environmental conditions or load may lead to inherently unpredictable time-series. Detecting anomalies in such scenarios becomes challenging using standard approaches based on mathematical models that rely on stationarity, or prediction models that utilize prediction errors to detect anomalies. We propose a Long Short Term Memory Networks based Encoder-Decoder scheme for Anomaly Detection (EncDec-AD) that learns to reconstruct 'normal' time-series behavior, and thereafter uses reconstruction error to detect anomalies. We experiment with three publicly available quasi predictable time-series datasets: power demand, space shuttle, and ECG, and two real-world engine datasets with both predictive and unpredictable behavior. We show that EncDec-AD is robust and can detect anomalies from predictable, unpredictable, periodic, aperiodic, and quasi-periodic time-series. Further, we show that EncDec-AD is able to detect anomalies from short time-series (length as small as 30) as well as long time-series (length as large as 500).},

abstract = {The prevalence of networked sensors and actuators in many real-world systems such as smart buildings, factories, power plants, and data centers generate substantial amounts of multivariate time series data for these systems. The rich sensor data can be continuously monitored for intrusion events through anomaly detection. However, conventional threshold-based anomaly detection methods are inadequate due to the dynamic complexities of these systems, while supervised machine learning methods are unable to exploit the large amounts of data due to the lack of labeled data. On the other hand, current unsupervised machine learning approaches have not fully exploited the spatial-temporal correlation and other dependencies amongst the multiple variables (sensors/actuators) in the system for detecting anomalies. In this work, we propose an unsupervised multivariate anomaly detection method based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Instead of treating each data stream independently, our proposed MAD-GAN framework considers the entire variable set concurrently to capture the latent interactions amongst the variables. We also fully exploit both the generator and discriminator produced by the GAN, using a novel anomaly score called DR-score to detect anomalies by discrimination and reconstruction. We have tested our proposed MAD-GAN using two recent datasets collected from real-world CPS: the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) and the Water Distribution (WADI) datasets. Our experimental results showed that the proposed MAD-GAN is effective in reporting anomalies caused by various cyber-intrusions compared in these complex real-world systems.},
