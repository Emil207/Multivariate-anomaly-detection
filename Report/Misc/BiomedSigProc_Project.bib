To establish a framework for a proposed improvement to the standard k-means algorithm, the results obtanained from experiments of the k-means in the Matlab package and databases of the UCI repository a represented.},

@article{Petrenas2015,
abstract = {This study describes an atrial fibrillation (AF) detector whose structure is well-adapted both for detection of subclinical AF episodes and for implementation in a battery-powered device for use in continuous long-term monitoring applications. A key aspect for achieving these two properties is the use of an 8-beat sliding window, which thus is much shorter than the 128-beat window used in most existing AF detectors. The building blocks of the proposed detector include ectopic beat filtering, bigeminal suppression, characterization of RR interval irregularity, and signal fusion. With one design parameter, the performance can be tuned to put more emphasis on avoiding false alarms due to non-AF arrhythmias or more emphasis on detecting brief AF episodes. Despite its very simple structure, the results show that the detector performs better on the MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation database than do existing detectors, with high sensitivity and specificity (97.1{\%} and 98.3{\%}, respectively). The detector can be implemented with just a few arithmetical operations and does not require a large memory buffer thanks to the short window.},

@article{Tuboly2015,
abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common types of arrhythmia which significantly increases the risk factor of stroke – especially in elderly population. In this paper an algorithm is presented which is suitable for the effective detection of AF, by using merely heart rate data as input. The method is based on the processing of Poincar{\'{e}} plots constructed from the set of 30 RR intervals. During the analysis of Poincar{\'{e}} plots the dispersion of points around the diagonal line is calculated and the number of clusters is determined by a self-developed cluster analyzer. The decision criterion of AF relies on these two parameters. On the one hand, the algorithm was tested on 10 AF and 10 normal rhythm ECG signals of the PhysioNet Database, achieving the average sensitivity (Se) of 98.69{\%} and the average specificity (Sp) of 99.59{\%}. On the other hand, 10 AF and 10 normal clinically confirmed records of a heart rate meter were also processed, resulting the average Se and Sp of 96.89{\%} and 99.00{\%}, respectively.},
