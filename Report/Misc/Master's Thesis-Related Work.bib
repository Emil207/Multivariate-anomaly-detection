abstract = {With widespread adoption of electronic health records, there is an increased emphasis for predictive models that can effectively deal with clinical time-series data. Powered by Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in several clinical prediction tasks. Despite the success of RNNs, its sequential nature prohibits parallelized computing, thus making it inefficient particularly when processing long sequences. Recently, architectures which are based solely on attention mechanisms have shown remarkable success in transduction tasks in NLP, while being computationally superior. In this paper, for the first time, we utilize attention models for clinical time-series modeling, thereby dispensing recurrence entirely. We develop the SAnD (Simply Attend and Diagnose) architecture, which employs a masked, self-attention mechanism, and uses positional encoding and dense interpolation strategies for incorporating temporal order. Furthermore, we develop a multi-task variant of SAnD to jointly infer models with multiple diagnosis tasks. Using the recent MIMIC-III benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in all tasks, outperforming LSTM models and classical baselines with hand-engineered features.},

abstract = {Aiming at the anomaly detection in multivariate time series(MTS), we propose a real-time anomaly detection algorithm in MTS based on Hierarchical Temporal Memory(HTM) and Bayesian Network(BN), called RADM. First of all, we use HTM model to evaluate the real-time anomalies of each univariate time series(UTS) in MTS. Secondly, a model of anomalous state detection in MTS based on Naive Bayesian is designed to analyze the validity of the above MTS. Lastly, considering the real-time monitoring cases of the system states of terminal nodes in Cloud Platform, we utilize ternary time series of CPU utilization, Network speed and Memory occupancy ratio as data samples, and through the experimental simulation, we verify that RADM proposed in this paper can take advantage of the specific relevance in MTS and make a more effective judgment on the system anomalies.},

@article{Baragona2007,
abstract = {In multivariate time series, outlying data may be often observed that do not fit the common pattern. Occurrences of outliers are unpredictable events that may severely distort the analysis of the multivariate time series. For instance, model building, seasonality assessment, and forecasting may be seriously affected by undetected outliers. The structure dependence of the multivariate time series gives rise to the well-known smearing and masking phenomena that prevent using most outliers' identification techniques. It may be noticed, however, that a convenient way for representing multiple outliers consists of superimposing a deterministic disturbance to a gaussian multivariate time series. Then outliers may be modeled as nongaussian time series components. Independent component analysis is a recently developed tool that is likely to be able to extract possible outlier patterns. In practice, independent component analysis may be used to analyze multivariate observable time series and separate regular and outlying unobservable components. In the factor models framework too, it is shown that independent component analysis is a useful tool for detection of outliers in multivariate time series. Some algorithms that perform independent component analysis are compared. It has been found that all algorithms are effective in detecting various types of outliers, such as patches, level shifts, and isolated outliers, even at the beginning or the end of the stretch of observations. Also, there is no appreciable difference in the ability of different algorithms to display the outlying observations pattern.},

@article{Zhang2019a,
abstract = {Nowadays, multivariate time series data are increasingly collected in various real world systems, e.g., power plants, wearable devices, etc. Anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time series refer to identifying abnormal status in certain time steps and pinpointing the root causes. Building such a system, however, is challenging since it not only requires to capture the temporal dependency in each time series, but also need encode the inter-correlations between different pairs of time series. In addition, the system should be robust to noise and provide operators with different levels of anomaly scores based upon the severity of different incidents. Despite the fact that a number of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms have been developed, few of them can jointly address these challenges. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Convolutional Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (MSCRED), to perform anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time series data. Specifically, MSCRED first constructs multi-scale (resolution) signature matrices to characterize multiple levels of the system statuses in different time steps. Subsequently, given the signature matrices, a convolutional encoder is employed to encode the inter-sensor (time series) correlations and an attention based Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network is developed to capture the temporal patterns. Finally, based upon the feature maps which encode the inter-sensor correlations and temporal information, a convolutional decoder is used to reconstruct the input signature matrices and the residual signature matrices are further utilized to detect and diagnose anomalies. Extensive empirical studies based on a synthetic dataset and a real power plant dataset demonstrate that MSCRED can outperform state-ofthe-art baseline methods.},

abstract = {Multivariate time series (MTS) datasets broadly exist in numerous fields, including health care, multimedia, finance, and biometrics. How to classify MTS accurately has become a hot research topic since it is an important element in many computer vision and pattern recognition applications. In this paper, we propose a Mahalanobis distance-based dynamic time warping (DTW) measure for MTS classification. The Mahalanobis distance builds an accurate relationship between each variable and its corresponding category. It is utilized to calculate the local distance between vectors in MTS. Then we use DTW to align those MTS which are out of synchronization or with different lengths. After that, how to learn an accurate Mahalanobis distance function becomes another key problem. This paper establishes a LogDet divergence-based metric learning with triplet constraint model which can learn Mahalanobis matrix with high precision and robustness. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied on nine MTS datasets selected from the University of California, Irvine machine learning repository and Robert T. Olszewski's homepage, and the results demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is an important data mining task with applications to ecosystem modeling, network traffic monitoring, medical diagnosis, and other domains. This paper presents a robust algorithm for detecting anomalies in noisy multivariate time series data by employing a kernel matrix alignment method to capture the dependence relationships among variables in the time series. Anomalies are found by performing a random walk traversal on the graph induced by the aligned kernel matrix. We show that the algorithm is flexible enough to handle different types of time series anomalies including subsequence-based and local anomalies. Our framework can also be used to characterize the anomalies found in a target time series in terms of the anomalies present in other time series. We have performed extensive experiments to empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. A case study is also presented to illustrate the ability of the algorithm to detect ecosystem disturbances in Earth science data.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a generic and scalable framework for automated anomaly detection on large scale time-series data. Early detection of anomalies plays a key role in maintaining consistency of person's data and protects corporations against malicious attackers. Current state of the art anomaly detection approaches suffer from scalability, use-case restrictions, difficulty of use and a large number of false positives. Our system at Yahoo, EGADS, uses a collection of anomaly detection and forecasting models with an anomaly filtering layer for accurate and scalable anomaly detection on time-series. We compare our approach against other anomaly detection systems on real and synthetic data with varying time-series characteristics. We found that our framework allows for 50-60{\%} improvement in precision and recall for a variety of use-cases. Both the data and the framework are being open-sourced. The open-sourcing of the data, in particular, represents the first of its kind effort to establish the standard benchmark for anomaly detection.},
annote = {No method individually is good enough.

Outlier detection is grouped into two classes of algorithms:
Plug-in methods
Model the normal behavior of the time-series such that a significant deviation from this model is considered an out- lier. To model the normal behavior of the input time-series we can plug-in a wide range of time-series modeling and fore- casting models (e.g. ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Kalman Filter, State Space Models, etc.) depending on the application and the nature of time-series.
Decomposition-based methods
The decomposition of time-series can be done both in the time-domain via smoothing or in the frequency-domain via spectral decomposition. The frequency-domain methods can be further divided into parameteric and non-parametric methods.},
