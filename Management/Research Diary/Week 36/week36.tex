\title{Research Diary - Example Entry}

{\Huge Weekly summary}\\[5mm]

\section*{Monday, September 2}
Meeting with Mattias. Got data from Sandvik. Probably Nibe. 
He sent over his presentation of MAD. Extra variable made with isolation forest.
Study isolation forest paper. 
Target: Given from Maximo.
Variable selection with two methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item  Discretization of continuous variables
\item  PCA to reduce colinearity
\end{itemize}
Training of model:
\begin{itemize}
\item  With random forest and XGBoost, neural networks could be used.
\end{itemize}

Remember Bayes theorem! The precision will be low even with high specificity and sensitivity since anomalies only correspond to a small part of the dataset.


\section*{Tuesday, September 3}
Sick!

\section*{Wednesday, September 4}
Working with Sandvik data. Preprocessed the data and made isolation forest variable.

\section*{Thursday, September 5}
Try to expand to larger dataset. 

Questions to Mattias:
Why is the Sandvik data missing a lot of days?
How to differentiate between noise and anomaly?
